This folder contains an example of using Init-For-LFS to start up a users desktop, copy the StartupServices folder to your home directory, and start services by:

servicermt RUNALL

This will go through the  '~/StartupServices/servicedata/services' file starting any services and running any commands it sees, this is my start up file so you will of course have to modify it to suit yourself.

I use the xinitrc.lfs example also in this folder to actually start the services when starting X.
Runtime folders will be created when you run the above command.

For extra info on what commands can be run use:

servicermt HELP
