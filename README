How To

!!!MAKE BACKUPS OF ALL MOVED OVERWRITTEN FILES OR ELSE!!!

Copy files/folders in etc to /etc
Build poweroff program ( See poweroff.cpp file )
Copy poweroff executable to /etc/StartupServices/poweroff
Copy runservices to /etc/StartupServices/runservices
Link /sbin/init to /etc/StartupServices/runservices
Link /sbin/shutdown and /sbin/reboot to /etc/StartupServices/runservices
Link /sbin/servicermt to /etc/StartupServices/runservices

All files default to being in /etc/StartupServices, you can change this by setting /etc/service.rc, when running as a normal user the rc file is  ~/.config/service.rc

Example:
SERVICEBASE=/home/keithhedger/StartupServices
SERVICERUNFOLDER=${SERVICEBASE}

You can run either as init or like I do as startup manager for my desktop I just use this line:
/home/keithhedger/StartupServices/runservices RUNALL &
in my xinitrc file
With this config file ~/.config/service.rc
SERVICEBASE=/home/keithhedger/StartupServices
SERVICERUNFOLDER=${SERVICEBASE}

Basic use:
./runservices HELP

Service run folder=/home/keithhedger/StartupServices
Service Data=/home/keithhedger/StartupServices/servicedata
Service File=services
Service Files=/home/keithhedger/StartupServices/servicefiles
Service run files=/home/keithhedger/StartupServices/servicerunfiles
Pid folder=/home/keithhedger/StartupServices/servicepids
Logs folder=/home/keithhedger/StartupServices/servicelogs
Format:
runservice RUN servicename
runservice RUNALL
runservice KILL servicename
runservice KILLALL
runservice LOGFILE servicename|ME
runservice RMLOG servicename
runservice RMALLLOGS
runservice PID servicename
runservice SHOWPIDS

Service file format:
COMMAND command to run
COMMAND second command to run
COMMAND ...
RUNTYPE	once|keepalive|nocontrol|wait, default once
LOGFILE path, default /home/keithhedger/StartupServices/servicelogs/service.log
PIDFILE path, default /home/keithhedger/StartupServices/servicepids/service.pid
STATUS service
PIDFILECNT pidcnt, set the auto PIDFILECNT var manually
Pipe commands to /home/keithhedger/StartupServices/servicepipe

Service files can run more than one command and they can be set to respawn if they exit eg the aggety.service:

COMMAND setsid /sbin/agetty --noclear
RUNTYPE	keepalive

RUNALL will run all service files ( *.service )

The main sercvice script is /etc/StartupServices/servicedata/services, by default though this can be changed via the config file, and can contain a mix of service files to run and normal commands eg:

/etc/StartupServices/startups/1
sleep 2

mkdir -vp "/run/StartupServices/servicerunfiles" "/run/StartupServices/servicelogs" "/run/StartupServices/servicepids"
mkfifo "/run/StartupServices/servicepipe"

/etc/StartupServices/startups/2

agetty.service tty2
agetty.service tty3
agetty.service tty4

Output will usually go to the console tty where the app has been starte from but you can redirect the output to another tty with the ECHOTOPTY command, eg set output to from init current pty:
servicermt ECHOTOPTY $(tty)
servicermt LOGFILE ME

...

The basic LFS syv scripts are used to do all the system start up stuff, with a few tweaks.

More documentaion to come!
A small boot movie is in the git repo ( "LFSDev.webm" ) which shows a basic lfs system booting using this init system.
